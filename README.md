# job-portal
This project is a MERN full-stack Job portal that I am currently making as a hobby project which can be used by both job seekers and recruiters. The job seekers can make an account with candidate role and find jobs relevant to their skill-set and apply. whereas recruiters can create recruiter account and post jobs and find candidates as per their requirements.

- The frontend of this project is React-Redux - Bootstrapped with CRA and typescript.
- The Database to be used will be MongoDB with mongoose ODM and hosted on Atlas.
- The backend will be primarily Node/Express.js. where express endpoints will be hit-on by the frontend to get retrieve relevant data from the database and hydrate the frontend.


---I will keep on updating the readme as I work and make more changes.
